## Books and Papers I Like

## Here are some academic books and papers I enjoyed reading recently

* Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences by Justin Grimmer,  Margaret E. Roberts, and Brandon M. Stewart
  - A big, thoughtful, timely, and instructive tomb on text data. From where I'm sitting, it looks like automated text analysis (or natural langauge processing, whatever you want to call it) is a method that is *just* on the verge of taking off in popularity in the social sciences. Books like this are important in that I suspect they will inform the paradigm that dominates the fields of research that spring up around text analysis. Given this, I'm glad that Text as Data dedicates a large number of pages to things like the ethics of text scraping, limitations of text data, potential for researcher bias, and problems with causal inference.
    

* Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson
  - A great introduction to wrangling text data. If I were designing an undergrad curriculum for text analysis for social sciences, this would be the first assigned reading. 


* Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R by Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge
  - I think of this book as the exciting sequel to Text Mining with R. It's definitely recommended reading for anyone learning the basics of text analysis. This book had a humbling and instructive effect on me when I originally read it in late 2023. I was about 60% of the way through when I realized that I was way too cocky with my text analysis skills, and that I'd need to spend some time getting to grips with the conceptual side of language processing before I jump into my text project.

 
* Measuring Media Criticism with ALC Word Embeddings by Christopher Barrie, Neil Ketchley, Alexandra Siegel, and Mossaab Bagdouri
  - This paper introduces a very cool and creative method of assessing attitudes toward a construct over time. In fact, I liked it so much that I had to design my own study which takes advantage of ALC embeddings.


* Applied Predictive Modeling by Kjell Johnson and Max Kuhn
  - Talk about a catchy title. This book is really well-written, with clear explanations of basic machine learning concepts. I think this should be required reading for all social science grad students. Busy grad students may wish to skip to page 522 for a discussion of Type III errors, and page 540 for the rationale for obtaining better quality samples rather than just larger samples.


## Books I'm currently reading

* Tree-Based Methods for Statistical Learning in R by Brandon M. Greenwell


* Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data by Jake VanderPlas


## For the curious, here are some non-academic books I've enjoyed recently

* Book of the New Sun
  - Really enjoyable and creative fantasy with excellent worldbuilding and a real sense of danger. I didn't like that the protagonist tortured cats, though. This series was rendered no less entertaining for the fact that I kept hoping the protagonist would get his commupance.


* Poldark series by Winston Graham
  - Graham is one of those authors with real insight into human psychology. The emotions, drives, and ruminations of his characters are incredibly believable. That said, this series isn't a character-driven period drama in the style of Georgette Heyer, it's more of a historical epic. A great deal of attention was paid to the effects of real events that occurred during the timeline of the series (1780 to 1820 ish).

 
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey
  - This is an underrated series. I'm no economist, but one of the things I most appreciate about this book is its commitment to economic realism. Food is scarce, air is scarce, water is scarce. Another thing I liked is how uncomfortable Corey made space travel. This isn't Star Wars, where light-speed jumps create about the same inertia as flooring the accelerator on a Volkswagen Golf. In The Expanse, space travel pushes you to your physical limit. Incidentally, I read half of these books by a cosy fire at my mum's property in outback Australia, and the other half on the plane to and from the US. This latter reading experience was very immersive - I too was pushed to my physical limits of discomfort. 


* Plainsong by Kent Haruf
  - I found this book a bit of a stressful read. Despite the peaceful title and gorgeous setting in the Colorado highlands, almost every chapter carries a sense of anxiety and possible tragedy. I wouldn't call it a fun read. Rather, it's a book that makes you reflect on moral values and principles. Come to think of it, there's a certain fun in that.
