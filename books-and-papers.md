## Books and Papers I Like

## Here are some academic books and papers I enjoyed reading recently

* Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences by Justin Grimmer,  Margaret E. Roberts, and Brandon M. Stewart
  - A big, thoughtful, timely, and instructive tomb on text data. From where I'm sitting, it looks like automated text analysis (or natural langauge processing, whatever you want to call it) is a method that is *just* on the verge of taking off in popularity in the social sciences. Books like this are important in that I suspect they will inform the paradigm that dominates the fields of research that spring up around text analysis. Given this, I'm glad that Text as Data dedicates a large number of pages to things like the ethics of text scraping, limitations of text data, potential for researcher bias, and problems with causal inference.


* Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson
  - A great introduction to wrangling text data. If I were designing an undergrad curriculum for text analysis for social sciences, this would be the first assigned reading. 


* Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R by Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge
  - I think of this book as the exciting sequel to Text Mining with R. It's definitely recommended reading for anyone learning the basics of text analysis. This book had a humbling and instructive effect on me when I originally read it in late 2023. I was about 60% of the way through when I realized that I was way too cocky with my text analysis skills, and that I'd need to spend some time getting to grips with the conceptual side of language processing before I jump into my next text project.


The rise and fall of technological development in virtual communities by Natalia Velez, Charley M. Wu, Samuel J. Gershman, Eric Schulz
 - As soon as I read this paper, I knew it was going in the coveted Burnett-Books-and-Papers-Website-Section-that-Nobody-Reads. Back when I had spare time, I was an avid gamer and loved open-world multiplayer games like 'One Hour One Life'. There is so much to learn about social (and political) psychology from the way people chose to play games in the open-world MMORPG genre - in which provide players are essentially just provided with a set of tools (e.g., the ability to farm, mine, build) and then left to decide how to organise themselves. One question that interests me about social behaviours within this context is the question of altruism - are people more altruistic because real suffering/death is not a possible consequence for oneself (you dying in the game because you were nice is no biggie), or are they less altruistic because real suffering/death is not a possible consequence for others (others dying in the game because you were mean is no biggie)?

 
* Measuring Media Criticism with ALC Word Embeddings by Christopher Barrie, Neil Ketchley, Alexandra Siegel, and Mossaab Bagdouri
  - This paper introduces a very cool and creative method of assessing attitudes toward a construct over time. In fact, I liked it so much that I decided I had to design my own study which uses ALC embeddings in a similar way.


* Applied Predictive Modeling by Kjell Johnson and Max Kuhn
  - Talk about a catchy title. This book is really well-written, with clear explanations of basic machine learning concepts. There's a lot social scientists looking into ML can get from this book. Busy grad students may wish to skip to page 522 for a discussion of Type III errors, and page 540 for a rationale for obtaining better quality samples rather than just larger samples. 


## Books I'm currently reading

* Tree-Based Methods for Statistical Learning in R by Brandon M. Greenwell
  - Did you know you can do basically everything using tree-based methods? Looking for outliers? Isolation forest. Want to do a clustering analysis? Extract a proximity matrix from a random forest. Imbalanced data (e.g., classification task where 1% of the sample are hits)? Gradient boosted trees. Fingers sore from typing too much? Go outside and climb a real tree. 
    
* Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett Rogers

* Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data by Jake VanderPlas


## For the curious, here are some non-academic books I've enjoyed recently

* Book of the New Sun
  - Really enjoyable and creative fantasy with excellent worldbuilding and a real sense of danger. I didn't like that the protagonist tortured cats, though. That said, this series was rendered no less entertaining for the fact that I kept hoping the protagonist would get his commupance.


* Poldark series by Winston Graham
  - Graham is one of those authors with real insight into human psychology. The emotions, drives, and ruminations of his characters are incredibly believable. That said, this series isn't a character-driven period drama in the style of Georgette Heyer, it's more of a historical epic. A great deal of attention was paid to the effects of real events that occurred during the timeline of the series (1780 to 1820 ish).

 
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey
  - This is such an underrated series. I'm no economist, but one of the things I most appreciate about this book is its commitment to economic realism. Food is scarce, air is scarce, water is scarce. Another thing I liked is how uncomfortable Corey made space travel. This isn't Star Wars, where light-speed jumps create about the same inertia as flooring the accelerator on a Volkswagen Golf. In The Expanse, space travel pushes you to your physical limit. Incidentally, I read half of these books by a cosy fire at my mum's property in outback Australia, and the other half on the plane to and from the US. This latter reading experience was very immersive - I too was pushed to my physical limits of discomfort. 


* Plainsong by Kent Haruf
  - I found this book a bit of a stressful read. Despite the peaceful title and gorgeous setting in the Colorado highlands, almost every chapter carries a sense of anxiety and possible tragedy. I wouldn't call it a fun read. Rather, it's a book that makes you reflect on moral values and principles. Although, here's a certain fun in that if you're someone who likes aimlessly moralizing in their spare time - like me.
